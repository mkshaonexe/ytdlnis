## Shortest changelog ever

- Fixed multiple download card issues. Processing them in the background was not a good idea for most users as it was confusing and users thought it wasnt doing anything. It led to duplicate downloads
Usually playlist downloads dont really have 4000 items in them so background. If you have one, just enable quick download and consider the whole playlist as a single item. :)

- Some users had issues with the display over apps perm. Since that perm ended up not doing anything to the revanced issue, i removed it

Had to push this out since multiple download card was almost broken
