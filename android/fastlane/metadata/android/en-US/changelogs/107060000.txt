## Background processing of items for download

Someone tested to download a 4000 long playlist in the app. First of all it couldnt even load them in the multiple download card. In those extreme cases the usual recommendation was to just turn quick download on, and consider the whole playlist as a single item and download.

But still, if a madman wants the ability to modify the list, now the app can handle it and will show the download card. Since it will take a while until all items all processed and converted into download items, a progress bar is added.
Still you are able to hit download and schedule button early and let the app continue on its own by using the default configurations of the download items. So its fast like quick download but still separates all items into separate downloads.
