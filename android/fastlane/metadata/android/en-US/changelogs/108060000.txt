# What's Changed

- Fix app sometimes giving you dubbed audio format instead of original audio
- Fix app crashing sometimes when pasting a link to terminal, also btw u can enable color highlight if disabled, wont crash the app i guess
- Make sponsorblock preference clear by default
- For playlists app now uses --lazy-playlist to load large playlists continuously in pages like newpipe does, its faster
- Enable / Disable certain cookie records instead of all at once
and more
