# What's Changed

- Fixed downloads crashing on items with titles that have quotes in them
- Removed custom format sorting by default to avoid common issues with format selection, and moved the preferences to advanced settings. Most of users don't need to customize sorting formats anyway :)
- Fixed app sometimes building -f as bv/bv+ba/b instead of bv+ba/bv/b
- Update WorkManager library, hopefully fixing #720
- Other small things
