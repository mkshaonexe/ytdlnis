## Duplicate checking

For a while the app had its own duplicate checking system when it checked the whole configuration with current history items or active downloads.
Since this system was too precise and even a slight change in options will consider it a new download and not an exact replica and most people were confused why the app allowed them to still download
So i created 3 methods of duplicate checking

- download archive -> uses the .txt file of yt-dlp to check if any url has been downloaded before or not
- url and type -> checks download history and running downloads to check if any item with the same url and type was downloaded
- full config -> the good ol method

----

- Removed paused button for each active download item. It didnt make sense. If you paused one item, the other items will continue to run anyway so what was the point. Instead i added a floating action button to pause and resume the whole queue
- Removed the cookie toggle throbbing every time you entered the page
- Slight changes to album_arist metadata parsing
- Fixed app downloading music file instead when using M4A music format
- Fixed app showing the grey deleted filter on present items


## Reordering download queue items

Now you can toggle the drag and drop mode in the queued tab to reorder your items with ease. Also you can now move multiple items to the top and to the bottom of the queue. or a single item
