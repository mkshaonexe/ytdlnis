# What's Changed

- Extra Command bug fixes
- Added ability to quickly download all saved items from the top menu
- Made app delete bad info json file if it failed with JSONDecodeError
- Sorted the subtitles in the subtitle selection dialog, and they show which ones are selected correctly
- Prevented app from calling yt-dlp every time on updating settings to check version

Hopefully this release is stable enough since there will be some few changes in the next version
