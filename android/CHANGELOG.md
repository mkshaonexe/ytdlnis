- All options in this screen that previously could apply to all items are implemented for this function.

## Other changes:

- App now can show FFmpeg output in the download card to avoid confusion on cases where it might appear as if the download is stuck but its running a ffmpeg subprocess

## For advanced users:

For anyone who is using intent arguments in YTDLnis for automation, the COMMAND argument has been removed. This is due to a found security vulnerability by SonarPaul where user information and app integrity could be compromised. Read the pdf for more information in the YTDLnis Updates Telegram Channel.

If you were using that argument for extra commands with audio/video downloads, you could make a command template about it and use it as extra command and also add a url regex if you want.


> # 1.8.4 (2025-04)

# What's Changed

## Added ability to set custom url for home recommendations

You can technically set anything like this and yt-dlp will process it just as how it can if you search it in the home screen.

> # 1.8.3 (2025-03)

# What's Changed

## Automatically generate WEB PO Tokens & Visitor Data inside the app

Since youtube is enforcing a policy that sessions need po tokens, you might need them to appear more legitimate and not get errors like 403, or even unlock formats that need po tokens.

With some references from LibreTube and OuterTune, the app now has a po token generator using it's WebView.
These records are stored in the apps preferences. In advanced settings now there is a toggle to enable the use of the tokens in yt-dlp.

Some formats need PO Token to show up like HIGH AUDIO, you will need to log in with cookies and then generate the tokens. There is also the option to use visitor data but you need to disable cookies. 
yt-dlp doesn't recommend using it but the option is there if u need it.

The app will apply these settings as youtube extractor arguments
youtube:player_client=web;po_token=web.gvs+GVS_TOKEN,web.player+PLAYER_TOKEN;player-skip=webpage,configs;visitor_data=VISITOR_DATA
If you have po tokens set up with web client with po token, there might be duplication happening, so check that out.
Also since these tokens work for any web client, there is also an option to select which web clients to include as extractor arguments.

Other stuff
- Cut Section has been reworked,thanks to madmini. Now you can cut down to milliseconds.
- Added safeBrowsingEnabled in WebView for generating cookies for devices of API 26 and above. Thought to generate incognito cookies that last longer
- Added feature to reset all settings belonging to a certain preference page
- Added option to turn off the code color highlighter
- Fixed app not applying prefer small sized formats. It should've been last in format sorting not first.
- Added ability to enable automatic backup when the app checks for new update and finds one
- Added write-subs and write-auto-subs and --compat-options no-keep-subs when the user embeds subs but doesnt want to save them so he can get more subtitles to embed
- Turned the changelog dialog to a separate screen for better visibility
- Added --external-downloader-args aria2c:"--check-certificate=false" to fix aria2 not working
- Added bitrate info for audio formats card in the download card
- Some small bug fix here and there

> # 1.8.2.2 (2025-02)

# What's Changed

- Hot fixes with format sorting in GUI
- Got those leftover translations

> # 1.8.2.1 (2025-02)

# What's Changed

- Fixed downloads crashing on items with titles that have quotes in them
- Removed custom format sorting by default to avoid common issues with format selection, and moved the preferences to advanced settings. Most of users don't need to customize sorting formats anyway :)
- Fixed app sometimes building -f as bv/bv+ba/b instead of bv+ba/bv/b
- Update WorkManager library, hopefully fixing #720
- Looks like adding preferred language in -S is useless so i added it as part of ba[lang^=...]
- Other small things

## Note

The alternate downloader Aria2c is broken, so turn it off for the time being until something is found out how to fix it/

Hopefully this build is stable for the time being!


> # 1.8.2 (2025-02)

## Note
This version has database updates. It's very unlikely you will face issues but make sure to make a backup of the app's data before updating to this version.

- added ability to backup logs as .txt file
- organized backups to their respective folders inside the YTDLnis folder. This includes logs, settings backups, and cookie exports

# Po Tokens & Player Clients

Now you can set up configurations for many youtube player clients and their respective GVS & Player PO Tokens.
Also if you want certain PO Tokens to apply only for a certain youtube url, like youtube music you can do that with URL Regex. 
These configurations will always be used, both in data fetching and in the download process

# Preferred Command Templates & URL Matching

Now command templates are more powerful than ever. The preferred command template is now reset but now you can set limitless preferred command templates. 
Along with that, you can now set URL Matching with a regex. You can set a preferred template for youtube downloads and one for reddit etc etc.
The same logic applies to command templates that are set as extra commands and as data fetching extra commands.

If you have multiple preferred command templates that dont have url regex setup, then one of them will be selected for command downloads.
If you have multiple command templates as extra commands without url regex, they will be added to any download.


> # 1.8.1.2 (2024-12)

# What's Changed

- Extra Command bug fixes
- Added ability to quickly download all saved items from the top menu
- Made app delete bad info json file if it failed with JSONDecodeError
- Sorted the subtitles in the subtitle selection dialog, and they show which ones are selected correctly
- Prevented app from calling yt-dlp every time on updating settings to check version

Hopefully this release is stable enough since there will be some few changes in the next version

> # 1.8.1.1 (2024-12)

# What's Changed

- Fixed some preferences having wrong description
- Fixed app not matching vp9 formats sometimes
- Fixed command templates order icon 
- Fixed app crashing when going landscape on large tablets
- Player Client preference is now reset so its empty by default. If you had modified it, please set it again :)
- Added ability for the app to also move the write info json files along with the video if the user requests it as extra command
- Made the re-download button always show the download card for error downloads 
- Used format sorting for selecting worst format instead of wv or wa

> # 1.8.1 (2024-11)

# What's Changed

- Implemented pagination in the History screen to help with large lists
- Added delete all for each page in the download queue screen
- Added accessing Terminal from the shortcuts menu of the app
- Made the download notifications grouped together
- Fixed app crashing when pressing the log of a download but the log has been deleted
- Fixed app crashing when queueing long list of items in the download queue
- Added ability to mass re-download items from the history screen
- Made the app remember the last used scheduled time so it can suggest you that time for the next download
- #618, made all preferences with a description show their values
- Fixed bug that prevented app from loading all urls from text file
- Added ability to stop an observed source but not delete it

## Custom yt-dlp source

Now you can create your own yt-dlp source the app can update to. 
The app is running yt-dlp --update-to user/repo@latest where user/repo is provided by you through the app. The default 3 sources are still there ofc.

# Advanced Settings

Added a new category for more advanced users and moved the extractor argument settings there.
- Added ability to make command templates usable while fetching data in the home screen. They will be appended to the data fetching command as an extra command in the end. Enable the toggle in the advanced settings to be able to configure your templates for it
- When PO Token is set, the app now adds the web extractor argument for youtube. I forgor...
  (If you want to set more PO tokens for other player clients i guess set them in the other extractor argument text preference, and also modify the player client. The separate PO Token preference applies it only for the web player client)

## Write Info Json

Added ability to write info json when downloading so when you resume and restart downloads, it will not download the webpage and player clients all over again. It will help prevent you making unnecessary calls to the server.
On advanced settings you can turn this off if you want.
I coded it be available for the next 5 hours. Considering formats tend to expire on some extractors, i dont want the download to be unusable. This is a rare use case, one of them being you starting a download, it saves the info json and you cancel it and you remember to start it again, maybe tomorrow lol. Formats most likely expired, download item is useless. So in that case it will redownload the the webpage and player clients again, and it will save a new info file aswell no problem.

## More Home recommendation options

Now you can select to have more youtube feeds in the home screen from yt-dlp 
- watch later playlist
- recommendations
- liked videos
- watch history

Since the option has been overhauled to put every home recommendation option in a single list-view preference, the preference has been reset so u have to change it again if you had changed it


> # 1.8.0 (2024-10)

# Notice

This version has the updated python version 3.11. Due to yt-dlp's deprecation of python 3.8, this update had to be made, but at the same time support for Android 6 will be dropped. Android 6 users can still keep using the previous version until yt-dlp stops working in the future.

# What's Changed

- Re-added individual pause button for downloads
- Added ability to set preferred command template
- Added PO Token setting for youtube extractor arguments
- Added customizable client for youtube extractor arguments
- Added preference to add extra youtube extractor arguments
- Added a header on cancelled/errored/scheduled/saved tabs to show the count and a dropdown menu to delete and copy urls instead of using the main queue screen menu
- Fixed app not starting scheduled downloads with the resume button if there were no paused downloads, weird ik
- Added Socket Timeout in Download Settings
- Fixed app not adding extra commands in the very end of the command list
- Fixed #580
- Small fixes on the home screen channel tab filters

> # 1.7.9.2 (2024-09)

# What's Changed

- newpipe extractor general fixes
- fixed newpipe formats not working
- removed piped because its more annoying than anything, it doesnt work currently
  *shortest changelog wr*


> # 1.7.9.1 (2024-09)

# What's Changed

## Newpipe Extractor

Since Piped is currently broken and unusable, i implemented the NEWPIPE EXTRACTOR to replace it. This includes:
- video queries
- playlist queries
- trending
- searching
- youtube channel queries
- formats
The speed is as fast as piped and seems to be working.
Now you can select between piped, newpipe or strictly rely on yt-dlp

## Home screen filtering

This is a feature request that is long overdue. When implementing newpipe extractor i also coded in proper youtube channel parsing. Now items have their respective channel playlist name. So the app will show you filter chips if you have multiple playlist available.
So you can filter between videos, shorts, livestreams and choose to just download those by long pressing etc etc.
In case newpipe fails and it defaults to yt-dlp, proper channel playlist parsing is not yet possible.
You can track the issue i have created here:
https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/10827

## Other fixes

- Fixed app selecting all playlist items even though user selected a few, if the user is parsing an instagram post. (they all had the same url)
- Fixed app not changing container label in the multiple download card when switching download type
- Fixed app not being able to return to home after clicking the download notification
- Added ability for the app to parse multiple urls at the same time. For now it will do 10 items at max
- Added ability to show "Continue Anyway" in the error dialog so it will keep showing the download card in case you want to save it for later or schedule it
- Added general subtitle variant codes with .*
- Fixed app not applying the subtitle language label in the subtitle configuration dialog
- Fixed app not showing the total format size when being in audio download type in the multiple downlod card
- Fixed app not navigating to the download queue fragment to adjust the errored download? Couldnt reprod but reworked logic lmk
- Fixed app still using original title for metadata even though the user changed it in the textfield
- Slight fixes for artist parsing for ytm videos
- Improved and simplified uploader parsing when quick downloading
- Ignored the recode command when using avi container, because it doesnt support it
- Prevented app selecting bad formats 233 and 234 when quick downloading
- Fixed app not showing best quality and worst quality labels depending on the user language
- Fixed app crashing when selecting formats of an instagram post with the same url
- Added approx filesize in yt-dlp formats, somehow the app was not adding it lol
- Added ability to remember text wrapping in download logs and terminal
- if quick download enabled, added ability to show the download card while sharing the txt file on any download type
- hide download size when enabling cutting because the size is unknown

## Note

Some people are asking for the ability to not use cache while downloading in usb storage. This is an android limitation. Even though you might have all files access, android still doesnt consider usb storage as main storage and cant directly write to it. So i have to use caching and then transfer the file.
If anyone is knowledgeable to pull this off, dm me on telegram and we can make it happen. :)

Also for people cutting really long videos and its slow. Its a yt-dlp / ffmpeg issue of how they handle that, so it can't be helped. I guess its best to just download it fully and cut it somewhere else.

I could've released this sooner but i have been busy :/

> # 1.7.9 (2024-07)

Available screens: Home, Downloads, Queue, Terminal, More
You can also select the label visibility of the bottom navigation

- Added a feature to choose if you want to restore the backup or erase everything from the app and start fresh with just the saved data
- Moved some youtube-focused settings to their own category in the general settings
- Other small things here and there

> # 1.7.7 (2024-06)

## Shortest changelog ever

- Fixed multiple download card issues. Processing them in the background was not a good idea for most users as it was confusing and users thought it wasnt doing anything. It led to duplicate downloads
Usually playlist downloads dont really have 4000 items in them so background. If you have one, just enable quick download and consider the whole playlist as a single item. :)

- Some users had issues with the display over apps perm. Since that perm ended up not doing anything to the revanced issue, i removed it

Had to push this out since multiple download card was almost broken

> # 1.7.6 (2024-06)

## What's New

- Made finished notification icon color to red
- Added download path in the history item details sheet
- Fixed Download On Schedule feature. Switched back to AlarmManager as its more accurate than WorkManager
- Removed move to top and to bottom in the scheduled tab. Code cleanup
- Fixed a huge issue when you press cancel to the quick download item before the data isn't fully fetched, it would go back to being queued after the data fetching is finally done
- moved force keyframes at cuts in the general category in processing settings
- showed the number when you select all items in the context menu bar
- fixed app going always to the search bar when you return to home if you launched the search shortcut from the app menu
- Fixed app not hiding update formats button after updating formats

- Fixed meta track parse metadata
- Fixed app not cancelling downloads in some cases
- Fixed huge issue when using multiple download card and it wouldnt keep user defined changes
- Fixed app not removing download notification when cancelling download
- Fixed some errors in arabic interface when selecting playlist items
- Limited characters in cut interface textboxes to just numbers colons and periods
- When user had a defined preferred format id and the user selects a generic 'best' format the app just accounted that format id and didnt consider the preferred video resolution as a fallback
- Fixed when trying to schedule a video download and setting it to download as audio as well, the audio is put in queued and not in scheduled
- Fixed app crashing when trying to tap adjust download in the errored notification, in case the user removed the download beforehand
- Added ability to modify the download item in the queue. But to prevent the app from starting the download prematurely, it is moved to the saved category and after you hit ok it will be requeued. If you cancel the edit card, the item will stay in saved
- Fixed app reseting user defined changes in the download card like the download path when it finally updates data
- Fixed app crashing when trying to open a download that has no duration in it. Now its disabled
- Previously the app would change the state of downloads to Paused, whether it is activepaused or queuedpaused. Since the app now simply pauses all downloads, there is no need to do such transformations especially when you could have many items in the queue. Now simply the app cancels the ytdlp instances and the download worker and stores a state whether the downloads are paused or not
- Fixed album playlist track not being saved  #482
- Fixed retries and fragment retries settings not applying
- Fixed container in RTL not showing correctly in video tab in the download card

- removed excessive file permissions for API 30 and above

## Format aspect importance

Now in the settings you can order around which element based on your preferences like codec, container, quality, preferred format id should be prioritised when the app automatically chooses a format for you. The app uses a weigh system to sort formats based on preference.

- fixed app crashing when swipe to delete a scheduled item
- fixed app not modifying time in a scheduled item
- added network constraint for observe sources worker
- added reconfigure button in errored notification
- fixed app not hiding the "Link you copied" after clicking on it
- fixed app crashing when trying to toast in the end (#469)
- added alternate urls for instagram,facebook,and reddit as supported sites
- fixed app not escaping double quotes in filenames
- fixed container text alignment for arabic interface
- rearranged video quality order in descending order in the settings


## Background processing of items for download

Someone tested to download a 4000 long playlist in the app. First of all it couldnt even load them in the multiple download card. In those extreme cases the usual recommendation was to just turn quick download on, and consider the whole playlist as a single item and download.

But still, if a madman wants the ability to modify the list, now the app can handle it and will show the download card. Since it will take a while until all items all processed and converted into download items, a progress bar is added.
Still you are able to hit download and schedule button early and let the app continue on its own by using the default configurations of the download items. So its fast like quick download but still separates all items into separate downloads.

- fixed app using -a "" on observe sources command type downloads
- added milliseconds when trying to cut a download
- added ability to set the folder location of your download archive path. The file has to be named as download_archive.txt
- added feature to number each chapter when using split by chapters

- other small fixes

- Fixed app not showing the current download's command if it was a command type download when coming from multiple download sheet
- Added release year from description as metadata for audio downloads

- Fix app crashing when trying to toggle on Show Terminal in share sheet
- Fix app crashing when going on landscape when you open the format list
- Fixed app not disabling the keep fragments toggle if you toggled the dont download as fragments

- Showed navigation bar color when opening the download card

- Showed the download path in the finished notification
- Fixed calculating the next time observe sources should run
- Added a scheduled section in the download queue so that they dont stay in the same spot with queued items that are expected to run soon. You can see their ETA there for each item


## Duplicate checking

For a while the app had its own duplicate checking system when it checked the whole configuration with current history items or active downloads.
Since this system was too precise and even a slight change in options will consider it a new download and not an exact replica and most people were confused why the app allowed them to still download
So i created 3 methods of duplicate checking

- download archive -> uses the .txt file of yt-dlp to check if any url has been downloaded before or not
- url and type -> checks download history and running downloads to check if any item with the same url and type was downloaded
- full config -> the good ol method

----

- Removed paused button for each active download item. It didnt make sense. If you paused one item, the other items will continue to run anyway so what was the point. Instead i added a floating action button to pause and resume the whole queue
- Removed the cookie toggle throbbing every time you entered the page
- Slight changes to album_arist metadata parsing
- Fixed app downloading music file instead when using M4A music format
- Fixed app showing the grey deleted filter on present items


## Reordering download queue items

Now you can toggle the drag and drop mode in the queued tab to reorder your items with ease. Also you can now move multiple items to the top and to the bottom of the queue. or a single item

-------

- removed the plus icon in the piped instance dialog.
- combined the thumbnail cropper and resizer commands in audio downloads
- fixed app not removing audio on some pre-merged formats like in tiktok or instagram
- removed the -f bv[height<=...] and instead moved to -S res:... due to some problems when trying to quick download an item
- fix terminal sometimes not showing the finishing line of output or error
- added colors to app shortcut icons

- Fixed app crashing when you selected a generic format for multiple items at once
- Fixed graphical glitch on RTL screens when the navigation bar showed up in landscape when moving tabs in download queue

## What's New

- Added names to subtitle codes in the subtitle selector dialog
- To prevent filename templates the app automatically adds .170B in the title tag and .30B in the uploader tag if they are written as the default template, otherwise they wont be tampered with
- Fixed app taking a bit before scheduling a download when it was quick downloaded

- Fixed app not updating playlist data thumbnail while downloading

- When clearing results in the home screen, the running query job is cancelled
- When creating a new cookie, hid the copy cookie button (duh!)
- Replaced some icons around the app

- Added the multiple download card as an option to disable the swipe gestures
- Added a recyclerview to the search results because they were buggy before and would not show sometimes

Instead of being separate, they are bundled and you can share them all at once and if you want to open the file a new dialog will show telling you to choose which one. If any of them is deleted, they are greyed out
- Fixed the shortcuts behaviour by allowing duplicate shortcuts to be added to textbox and to not check

# Format Filtering

App can now let you filter between 4 categories.
All, self explanatory.
Suggested, a combination of multiple preferences you have set in the app like your preferred codec, container and format id, quality and resolution.
Smallest, it will select for each format the smallest size.
Generic, the generic formats you see on the app while an item hasn't updated to real formats yet, in case you want to use those for some reason.

...

- Added clipboard button right in the home screen for quick access to the url you copied instead of going to the searchview. That item is also available there aswell.
- Added an animation of it shrinking when it pops up
- Added ability to show the URL in a history item if the download produced no title for it
- Same idea with the download notification if you hit download too fast and the data fetching process hadn't finished yet.
- Added zoom-in zoom-out slider for logs and terminal screens. It can remember your zoom choice for both
- Added more options of data fetching for titles and authors, like track, alt_title to avoid the default youtube naming scheme when available. Useful for audio downloads
- Since some people are confused. In the download card each tab item is independent and they each create a distinct download item and when you press download the app picks from the tab you are currently. If you want to select the audio format in the video tab you can just open the format list and scroll to the bottom for the audio formats. You can select multiple if you want and then press ok. But since some people thought that selecting the audio in audio tab would apply to the video tab, i added the ability to synchronise that format automatically in case people dont know about this lol
- Added the snackbar notification when there are no current command templates when trying to edit an existing download item
- Fixed that snackbar to fill the full text
- Fixed app crashing when trying to change the directory of multiple items in the multiple download card
- Fixed cases where the app downloaded a playlist but items had mismatching titles. This was due to playlist index being different from piped API to yt-dlp. Added filtering by ID instead which is fool-proof

# Introducing Observe Sources

A long awaited feature that was planned for a long time, but always pushed back by other features.
You can now set a playlist to be observed by the app over and over based on a time period.
The download configuration is the exact same as if you would do a normal download. You can select types of audio video and command etc etc.
You can set it to run every day, every week, every month. or every 2 days and so on.
You can set the time the app should try to check for new entries to download.
You can set the time the app will start this observation process, in case you dont want it to start now.
You can set the case where the app should stop running it. Like after 10 runs, or after it reaches a certain date.
The item can store which url's it had registered and passed over to the download process, so it can skip them on the next run.
But you can set it to check the app's internal download history in case those files are still present. If not, the app will try to re-download them again.
You can make as much as you want :), but since its running on Alarm Manager its waking up the phone to run the task so be wary of battery usage if you have way too many of them.

Accepted variables:

TYPE -> it can be: audio,video,command
BACKGROUND -> whether the app downloads on its own and wont show the download card if you have it on
The intent that needs to be created is of android.intent.action.SEND and the intent text should be the url that you need to download.

# PLEASE READ

Due to high app usage, my personal youtube api key was throttled. I removed the built-in api key for default yt-dlp requests. They are slower but usable to everyone. You can add your own youtube api key in the setttings for faster responses. Refer to the readme for steps on how to get your own key. 

## NEW FEATURES

- made the download progress not cut off and be seamless when transitioning from intermediate to solid colors
- renamed history tab to downloads
- downloaded items if they are not in the filesystem, they are greyed out

- made checking for updates as a toggle in the main settings page.
- downloading items now show in the downloads tab too and you can cancel them there aswell.
- added incognito mode. If on, downloaded stuff wont be added to history / downloads tab
- added a cancel button in the notification itself. It will cancel everything and clear the queue
- added bottom cards when you click audio / video buttons to configure some settings before downloading. You can change title and artist name, change format, and quality if you are choosing video. If you have selected mutliple items or are downloading everything present, you can't edit title and artist because you are dealing with multiple items.
- added a button to open the downloaded file. If the file is greyed out (file is not present) the button won't be there
- added ability to import a txt file. Create a simple txt file contaning any link that yt-dlp supports. You can also use youtube playlist links or simple queries. The app will read each line and update the screen. When finished, download all floating action button will appear. To use this feature just share the txt file to this app
