📦 WHAT YOU'LL GET:
-------------------
A professional Windows EXE file that users can:
✅ Double-click to run

Option 1: EASY WAY (Double-click this!)
-----------------------------------------
1. Go to web-app folder

3. Run: npm run build-exe (builds EXE)
4. EXE will be in 'dist' folder


📁 OUTPUT FILES:
----------------

The build will create TWO versions in the 'dist' folder:

1. **Installer Version:** YTD-lins Web-Setup-1.0.0.exe
   → Full installer with shortcuts and uninstaller
   → Best for end users

2. **Portable Version:** YTD-lins Web-Portable-1.0.0.exe

Both work the same - users just double-click and start downloading!
